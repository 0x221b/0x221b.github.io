        <title>OWASP Top 10 OS Command Injection</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;I have decided to dig a little deeper into the OWASP top 10. I find web security such a vast subject (with new issues being found daily) that instead of chasing around every new issue I come across my time would be better spent getting a better understanding of the Top 10 first. I, like most people interested in information security, have been aware of the top 10 for a while and even had chance to set up labs or practice them on hack the box but this will be the first time I consolidate my knowledge in a blog for future reference. I believe this understanding will help me when I explore more niche vulnerabilities in the future. For those new to the subject and not aware of these 10, I list them below. Further details can also be found &lt;a href=&quot;https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
