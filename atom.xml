        <title>Finding, Exploiting and Escalating LFI</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Local File Inclusion or LFI is a vulnerability in web applications where input can be manipulated to read other files on the system that were not intented to be read by the web server. It occurs when the application accesses a file on the system using input that can be altered by the user. Then it is just a case of finding the right level of back tracks (../) to locate the files of interest.
LFI is a useful vulnerability to find but if there are no interesting files on the server there isn’t much you can do with it. Or is there?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Ghostcat Vulnerability (CVE-2020-1938)</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;To continue my theme of better late than never I have a quick write up of the ghost cat vulnerability. Probably old news to most but wanted to get my learning down on “paper” to help me organise my thoughts. I will start with a few definitions and then move on to the POC and remediations. The POC is from the room on Tryhackme.com.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>OWASP Top 10 OS Command Injection</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;I have decided to dig a little deeper into the OWASP top 10. I find web security such a vast subject (with new issues being found daily) that instead of chasing around every new issue I come across my time would be better spent getting a better understanding of the Top 10 first. I, like most people interested in information security, have been aware of the top 10 for a while and even had chance to set up labs or practice them on hack the box but this will be the first time I consolidate my knowledge in a blog for future reference. I believe this understanding will help me when I explore more niche vulnerabilities in the future. For those new to the subject and not aware of these 10, I list them below. Further details can also be found &lt;a href=&quot;https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
